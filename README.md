## How to run:

````python3
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd code
    python3 main.py -h
````

For testing purposes, testing.py was created. The file under evaluation is always texts/german2.txt, since this file provides a known number of exact word count: 7001  
How to run testing.py:  
````python3
    cd code
    python3 testing.py <int: number of tests>
````
